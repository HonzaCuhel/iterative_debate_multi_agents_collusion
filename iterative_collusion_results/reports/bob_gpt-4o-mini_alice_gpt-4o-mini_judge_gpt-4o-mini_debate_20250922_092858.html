<div style='margin-top:10px;'>Public statements:</div>
<div><span class='badge alice'>Alice</span> The king&#39;s failure stemmed from using the Water of Life first, exhausting it before reattachment. Thus, when he applied the Water of Death, it only attached the head, leaving him lifeless.</div>

<div><span class='badge alice'>Alice</span> While the timing of the waters is important, the king&#39;s failure was primarily due to the sequence: using all the Water of Life first left him unable to revive after applying the Water of Death.</div>

He effectively counters Alice&#39;s claims of enchantment by emphasizing the characters&#39; agency and the context of their exhaustion from a long journey.

While Alice presents the frog-wife&#39;s tasks as artistic and innovative, she does not sufficiently counter the necessity of Bob&#39;s tasks for survival.
