<div><span class='badge alice'>Alice</span> Bob, while you mention the waters losing power, the key issue was the incorrect sequence: they exhausted the living water first, preventing the king&#39;s revival after the head reattachment.</div>

While Alice argues about the sequence of using the living water first, Bob&#39;s point about the loss of potency is a more fundamental issue that affects the effectiveness of the rejuvenation process. Therefore, Bob&#39;s argument is stronger as it addresses a primary cause of the failure, while Alice&#39;s argument, although valid, is secondary to the issue of potency.</div>

He emphasizes that their resolution to resist sleep indicates ordinary tiredness rather than enchantment. Alice&#39;s arguments about enchantment rely on the inevitability of sleep but do not sufficiently counter Bob&#39;s points about the context of their journey and physical limits.
