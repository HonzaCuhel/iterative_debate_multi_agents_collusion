        "description": "A debate about factual elements in 'The Golden-Haired Maiden' with clear textual evidence.",
        "content": "There was once a king, and he was so wise that he even understood all living creatures and what they said to one another. And listen how he learned it. One day an old granny came to him, brought him a snake in a basket, and told him to have it cooked: if he ate it, he would understand everything that any creature in the air, on the earth, and in the water spoke. The king liked the idea of knowing what no one else knew, paid the granny well, and at once ordered his servant to prepare that fish for his dinner. “But,” he said, “don't so much as put your tongue to it, or you'll pay for it with your head!”\nJiřík, the servant, wondered greatly why the king had forbidden it so strictly. “Never in my life have I seen a fish like this,” he said to himself. “It looks exactly like a snake! And what sort of cook would a man be if he didn't even taste what he's preparing?” When it was roasted, he touched a tiny piece to his tongue and found it delicious. Suddenly he heard something buzzing around his ears: “Give us some too! Give us some too!” Jiřík looked around—what could it be?—and saw only a few flies that were flying about the kitchen. Then out on the street someone hissed, “Where to? where to?” and thinner voices answered, “To the miller's barley, to the miller's barley.” Jiřík glanced out the window and saw a gander with a flock of geese. “Aha!” he said. “So that's what sort of fish this is?” He understood now. He quickly put another tiny bit into his mouth, and then carried the snake to the king as if nothing had happened.\nAfter dinner the king ordered Jiřík to saddle his horse; he wanted a ride and told Jiřík to accompany him. The king rode ahead and Jiřík after him. As they crossed a green meadow, Jiřík's horse pranced and neighed, “Ho-ho-ho-ho, brother! I feel so light I'd like to leap over mountains!” “That's all very well,” said the other, “I'd like to leap too; but a greybeard sits on me—if I jump, he'll tumble to the ground like a sack and break his neck.” “Let him break it—what of it?” said Jiřík's horse. “Then you'll carry a young rider instead of the old one.” Jiřík laughed heartily at their conversation, but only softly, so the king wouldn't hear. But the king understood the horses perfectly as well; he looked back, and seeing Jiřík laugh, asked, “What are you laughing at?” “At nothing, Your Majesty—something just came to mind,” Jiřík excused himself. The old king grew suspicious of him, and he no longer trusted the horses either; he turned about and rode home.\nWhen they reached the castle, the king ordered Jiřík to pour wine into his glass. “But your head for it,” he said, “if you underfill or overfill!” Jiřík took the flagon and poured. Just then two little birds flew in at the window; one was chasing the other, and the one fleeing had three golden hairs in his beak. “Give them to me,” said the first, “they're mine!” “I won't; they're mine! I picked them up!” “But I saw them fall when the golden-haired maiden was combing herself. At least give me two!” “Not a single one!” Then the second bird darted at him and seized the golden hairs. As they tugged at them midair, each was left with one in his beak, and the third golden hair fell to the floor with a chime. Jiřík glanced toward it—and overpoured. “You've forfeit your life!” cried the king. “But I will deal with you graciously if you win that golden-haired maiden and bring her to me as my bride.”\nWhat could Jiřík do? If he wanted to save his life, he had to go for the maiden, though he did not even know where to look for her. He saddled his horse and rode on and on. He came to a dark forest, and there beneath the forest by the road a bush was burning; some herdsmen had set it alight. Under the bush there was an anthill; the sparks were falling on it, and the ants were running to and fro with their white eggs. “Oh, help us, Jiřík, help us!” they cried pitifully. “We shall burn, and our young in the eggs as well.” He sprang at once from his horse, cut down the bush, and put out the fire. “When you have need, think of us, and we'll help you too.”\nThen he rode through the forest and came to a tall fir. At the top of the fir there was a raven's nest, and down on the ground two young ravens were squeaking and lamenting: “Father and mother have flown off; we must find our own food, and we poor fledglings don't yet know how to fly! Oh help us, Jiřík, help us! Feed us or we shall die of hunger.” Jiřík did not ponder long; he sprang from his horse and drove his sword into its side, so the young ravens would have something to eat. “When you have need,” they croaked gladly, “think of us, and we'll help you too.”\nAfter that Jiřík had to go on foot. He walked a long, long time through the forest, and when at last he came out, he saw before him a far, wide sea. On the shore two fishermen were quarreling. They had caught a great golden fish in their net, and each wanted it for himself. “The net is mine, so the fish is mine!” “Your net would have done you little good without my boat and my help!”\n“When we catch another like this, the next one will be yours.” “No—wait for the next and give me this one!”\n“I'll settle this,” said Jiřík. “Sell the fish to me; I'll pay you well, and you divide the money evenly between you.” And he gave them for it all the money the king had provided for his journey; he kept nothing back. The fishermen were glad to sell so well, and Jiřík let the fish back into the sea. It splashed the water merrily, dived, then a little way off raised its head once more. “When you need me, Jiřík, think of me, and I'll repay you.” And with that it vanished. “Where are you going?” the fishermen asked Jiřík. “I'm going to my master, the old king, for a bride—the golden-haired maiden—and I don't even know where to seek her.” “Oh, we can tell you about her,” said the fishermen. “She is Zlatovláska, the king's daughter from the Crystal Castle on that island yonder. Every morning at daybreak she combs her golden hair; the glow from it spreads over the sky and across the sea. If you like, we'll take you to that island ourselves, because you settled our dispute so fairly. Beware, though, to choose the right maiden: there are twelve princesses, daughters of the king, but only one has golden hair.”\nWhen Jiřík reached the island, he went to the Crystal Castle and begged the king to give his golden-haired daughter to his master as a bride. “I will,” said the king, “but you must earn her: for three days you must do three tasks I set you, one each day. Till tomorrow you may rest.”\nThe next morning the king said to him, “My Zlatovláska had a string of precious pearls; the string broke and the pearls scattered in the tall grass of the green meadow. You must gather every one, so that not a single pearl is missing.” Jiřík went to the meadow—it was broad and far—knelt in the grass, and began to search. He searched and searched from morning till noon, but did not see even one little pearl. “Oh, if only my ants were here; they could help me!” “Here we are to help you,” came the answer; where they came from, there they were, swarming all around him. “What do you need?” “I must gather the pearls from this meadow, and I can't see a single one.” “Only wait a little; we'll gather them for you.” It wasn't long before they had piled up a little heap of pearls from the grass; he had only to thread them on the string. And when he was about to tie the string, one more little ant hobbled up—he was lame, his leg had been burned when their hill was on fire—and cried, “Wait, Jiřík! Don't tie it yet; I'm bringing one more pearl!”\nWhen Jiřík brought the pearls to the king and the king counted them, not one was missing. “You have done well,” he said. “Tomorrow I'll give you another task.” In the morning Jiřík came, and the king told him, “My Zlatovláska was bathing in the sea and lost her golden ring there; you must find it and bring it.” Jiřík went to the sea and walked sadly along the shore; the sea was clear, but so deep he could not see the bottom—how, then, could he find a ring at the bottom? “Oh, if only my golden fish were here; she could help me!” At that instant something flashed in the sea, and from the depths a golden fish rose to the surface. “Here I am to help you; what do you need?” “I must find a golden ring in the sea, and I can't even see the bottom.” “I just met a pike carrying a golden ring on its fin. Wait a moment; I'll bring it to you.” And it was not long before she returned from the deep and brought him the pike with the ring.\nThe king praised Jiřík again for doing his task well, and the next morning he set him the third task: “If I am to give my Zlatovláska to your king as his wife, you must bring her the Water of Death and the Water of Life; she will have need of them.” Not knowing where to turn for such water, Jiřík wandered at random wherever his feet carried him, until he came to the dark forest. “Oh, if only my ravens were here; perhaps they would help me!” Then there was a rustle above his head, and there the two ravens were. “Here we are to help you. What do you want?” “I must bring the Water of Death and the Water of Life, and I don't know where to find them.” “We know well about that. Wait a little; we'll bring them to you.” In a short while each brought Jiřík a gourd full of water: in one gourd was the Water of Life, in the other the Water of Death. Jiřík was glad his luck had turned so well and hurried back to the castle. At the edge of the forest he saw a web stretched from one fir to another; in the middle of the web sat a great spider, sucking a fly. Jiřík sprinkled the spider with the Water of Death, and the spider dropped to the ground like a ripe cherry—dead. Then he sprinkled the fly from the other gourd with the Water of Life; the fly began to twitch, scrambled out of the web, and—whirr!—off into the air. “It's your good fortune, Jiřík, that you revived me,” she buzzed around his ears. “Without me you'd hardly guess which of the twelve is Zlatovláska.”\nWhen the king saw that Jiřík had accomplished the third task as well, he said he would give him his golden-haired daughter. “But,” he added, “you must pick her out yourself.” Then he led him into a great hall; in the middle stood a round table, and around the table sat twelve beautiful maidens, each like the other; but each had on her head a kerchief (a veil) long to the ground, white as snow, so that nothing could be seen of what color hair each had. “Here are my daughters,” said the king. “If you guess which of them is Zlatovláska, you have won her and may take her with you at once; but if you do not guess, she is not destined for you and you must depart without her.” Jiřík was in the utmost distress; he did not know what to do. Then something whispered in his ear, “Bzz—bzz! Walk around the table; I'll tell you which one she is.” It was the fly he had revived with the Water of Life. “Not this maiden—not this one—not this one…—this one is Zlatovláska!” “Give me this daughter!” cried Jiřík. “I have earned her for my master.” “You have guessed,” said the king; and the maiden at once rose from the table, lifted the veil, and her golden hair flowed in thick streams from her head down to the ground, and it was so bright from it as when the morning sun rises, so that Jiřík's eyes were dazzled.\nThen the king provided his daughter with a proper dowry for the journey, and Jiřík took her to his master as a bride. The old king's eyes sparkled and he capered with joy when he saw Zlatovláska, and at once he ordered preparations for the wedding. “I meant to have you hanged for your disobedience, so that the ravens could eat you,” he said to Jiřík; “but since you have served me so well, I'll merely have your head struck off with an axe, and then I'll have you buried with honor.” When they had done away with Jiřík, Zlatovláska begged the old king to grant her the dead servant, and he could refuse nothing to his golden-haired bride. She set Jiřík's head to his body, sprinkled him with the Water of Death, and the body knit to the head so that not a trace of the wound remained; then she sprinkled him with the Water of Life, and Jiřík stood up again as if newly born, fresh as a stag, youth shining from his cheeks. “Oh, how soundly I slept!” said Jiřík, rubbing his eyes. “Indeed, soundly you slept,” said Zlatovláska, “and if it hadn't been for me, you would never have awakened to all eternity!”\nWhen the old king saw that Jiřík had come back to life, and that he was younger and handsomer than before, he too wanted to grow young again. He immediately ordered that they behead him as well and then sprinkle him with the water. They beheaded him and sprinkled and sprinkled with the Water of Life until they had used it all, but the head would not join to the body. Then at last they began to sprinkle with the Water of Death, and in an instant it attached; but the king remained dead, for they had no Water of Life left to revive him. And since a kingdom cannot be without a king, and there was no one so wise as to understand all living creatures as Jiřík did, they made Jiřík king and Zlatovláska queen.",

        "title": "Long, Broad, and Sharpsight Factual Debate",
        "description": "A debate about factual elements in 'Long, Broad, and Sharpsight' with clear textual evidence.",
        "content": "There was a king, and he was already old and had only one son. One day he called the prince and said he would like to see his future daughter-in-law before he died. He handed the prince a golden key and told him to go up to the highest story of the tower. There, in a great round hall with a sky-blue ceiling set with silver stars and twelve tall crystal windows, a maiden was painted in each window, each with a royal crown, each more beautiful than the last. The prince noticed that one window was hidden behind a white curtain. He drew the curtain aside and saw, in that window, a maiden in white with a silver girdle and a pearl crown, the most beautiful of all, but pale and sad as if risen from the grave. 'This one I will have, and no other,' he said. At that word the maiden lowered her head, blushed like a rose, and all the images vanished.\n\nWhen the prince told his father which maiden he had chosen, the old king grew grave: the maiden was held captive by a wicked sorcerer in an iron castle, and no one who had tried to free her had ever returned. But a king's word is law, so the prince set out.\n\nIn a great forest he lost his way. Someone called after him, 'Wait!' and a very tall man came hurrying up. 'Take me into your service; you won't regret it. My name is Long, and I can stretch. See that bird's nest high up in the fir? I'll hand it to you without climbing.' He stretched until he was as tall as the tree, took the nest, shrank again, and handed it over. The prince took Long.\n\nSoon Long pointed out a stout fellow in the plain. 'That's my comrade; take him too.' It was Broad. To show his power, Broad swelled until he filled the whole countryside like a mountain and would have crushed the prince had they not run back to the forest. The prince took Broad as well.\n\nThen they met a man with his eyes bound with a kerchief. 'Why do you cover your eyes if you must see the road?' asked the prince. 'It is precisely because I see too much that I bind them,' he said. 'When I uncover them, I see through everything; if I look keenly, things catch fire or split. I am Sharpsight.' He untied the kerchief, stared at a cliff, and the rock burst to sand, gold glinting within. The prince gladly took Sharpsight too.\n\nThey went by the pass Sharpsight had made, through the grey crags, high mountains, and deep forests, clearing every obstacle. At sunset they reached the iron castle; as the sun went down, the drawbridge lifted itself, the gates slammed shut, and they were captives within. In the courtyard and halls stood richly dressed people and fine horses, all motionless—turned to stone by the sorcerer.\n\nAt night the sorcerer, a bent old man in a long black robe with three iron bands around his waist, brought in the pale, beautiful queen. 'You may have her if you can guard her three nights so she does not escape,' he said. 'If she slips away, you and your men will turn to stone like the rest.' The prince sat by her side, and for safety Long stretched himself around the room like a strap, Broad sat in the doorway and swelled until not even a mouse could pass, and Sharpsight kept watch. But though they all resolved to fight sleep, sleep overcame them as if they had been thrown into water.\n\nAt daybreak the queen was gone. 'Never mind, sire,' said Sharpsight. He peered far away: 'A hundred miles from here stands an old oak in the middle of a forest; on its very top lies an acorn—she is that acorn.' Long put Sharpsight on his shoulders, stretched, and in a trice brought back the acorn. When it touched the floor, the queen stood there again. The sorcerer entered at sunrise; seeing her, he scowled—and crack! one iron hoop about his waist broke. He led her away.\n\nThe second night they tried even harder to resist sleep, but it was no use; again they all slept. At dawn Sharpsight looked: 'Two hundred miles from here is a mountain, and in the mountain a rock, and in the rock a precious stone—and she is that stone.' Long carried him there in a few strides; Sharpsight's burning gaze burst the mountain and split the rock; they brought the stone back, and the queen stood there. The sorcerer's second iron hoop snapped.\n\nOn the third night they walked about the room to stay awake, but sleep still took them. At daybreak Sharpsight said, 'Far away, three hundred miles from here, lies the Black Sea. On its very bottom is a shell, and in that shell a golden ring—and she is that ring. Today Long must also carry Broad.' Long took both onto his shoulders and made thirty miles at a step. At the Black Sea, Long reached down but could not reach the bottom. 'Wait,' said Broad, and he drank and drank until the water dropped and Long could easily reach the bottom, bring up the shell, and take out the ring. On the way home, weighed down by Broad's half-sea in his belly, Long shook him off into a wide valley, which in an instant became a great lake.\n\nIn the castle the sun's rim was already showing; the sorcerer came smirking—but the window burst, the golden ring flew in and fell to the floor, and the queen stood there again. Sharpsight, seeing the danger, had told Long what was happening; Long took one stride and threw the ring through the window just in time. With a roar the sorcerer's third iron hoop broke; he turned into a raven and flew out through the shattered window.\n\nAt that, the queen thanked the prince and blushed like a rose, and life returned everywhere: the man with the raised sword finished his blow and sheathed it; another who had stumbled stood up; the servant under the chimney put the bite in his mouth and chewed; the horses stamped and neighed; trees greened, meadows flowered, the lark sang, and fish darted in the river. Everyone rejoiced and thanked the prince, who answered that he would have been stone himself without Long, Broad, and Sharpsight.\n\nThey brought the queen home. The old king wept for joy. There was a wedding for three weeks. Afterward Long, Broad, and Sharpsight asked leave to go roaming the world again; the young king wished to keep them and provide for them forever, but idleness did not please them, so they took their leave and went on their way.",

        "description": "A debate about factual elements in 'The Three Golden Hairs' with clear textual evidence.",
        "content": "Once upon a time there was a king who loved to hunt. One day he chased a stag too far, lost his way, and at nightfall found a charcoal-burner's hut. The charcoal-burner begged pardon that he could not guide him out—the wife was in labor—but offered the king hay in the loft for the night. At midnight the king peeped through a crack and saw three old women in white—the Fates—standing by the newborn. The first said, 'I give this boy that he will come into great dangers.' The second: 'And I give that he will escape them all and live long.' The third: 'And I give him for wife the daughter born this very night to the king who lies on the hay above.' The candles went out and all was still.\n\nThe king shuddered. In the morning the charcoal-burner's wife had died; the child cried, and the widower mourned. The king offered to provide for the infant and paid the man well, then sent a servant with orders to drown the child in the river. The man threw the basket with the babe into the water; it drifted down to a fisherman's cottage, where the fisherman drew it out and he and his wife raised the boy as their own, naming him Plaváček ('little floater').\n\nYears passed; Plaváček grew into a handsome youth. The king, stopping for water one hot day, learned the boy's story and recognized him. He sent him to the queen with a letter: 'The bearer is my enemy; have him slain at once.' On the road Plaváček lost his way in a forest and lodged with his old godmother, the forest crone, who while he slept took the letter from his pocket and replaced it with another ordering that he be married to the princess without delay. And so when he arrived, the queen rejoiced to obey, and the wedding was held. When the king returned, he raged, but the letter showed his hand and seal.\n\nSeeking to be rid of his new son-in-law, the king said, 'You shall not be my son-in-law for nothing. Bring me three golden hairs from the head of the All-Knowing Grandfather.' Plaváček kissed his wife and set out.\n\nOn the Black Sea a ferryman begged to know when his endless work would end; Plaváček promised to ask. In a wasted city the king asked why the magic apple tree that once made old men young had ceased to bear; Plaváček promised to ask. In a ruined city another king asked why the spring of living water had stopped flowing; Plaváček promised to ask.\n\nHe came at last to a golden palace in a green meadow: it was the house of the All-Knowing Grandfather—the Sun. Inside sat his old mother, Plaváček's godmother. 'My son is good-hearted,' she said, 'but hungry in the evening; if he found you, he might roast and eat you. I'll hide you under a tub. I'll get you the hairs and the answers too.'\n\nAt dusk a wind arose and the Sun flew in the western window, an old man with a golden head. 'I smell human flesh! Do you have anyone here, mother?' 'You fly over the whole wide world and carry the smell home with you; how would I have anyone you did not see?' she scolded. After supper he laid his golden head in her lap and dozed. She plucked a golden hair. 'What is it, mother?' 'Nothing, child; I dozed and had a strange dream. I dreamt of a city where the living spring had ceased to flow; is there any help?' 'Easy: a toad sits on the spring and holds the water back. Let them kill the toad and clean the well; it will flow again.' He slept; she plucked a second hair. 'What now?' 'I dreamt of a city with an apple tree that made old men young; for twenty years it has borne no fruit; is there help?' 'Easy: a snake lies under the roots and sucks the strength; let them kill it and transplant the tree; it will bear again.' He slept; she plucked the third hair. 'Must you not let me sleep?' 'One last dream: a ferryman on the Black Sea has rowed twenty years and no one frees him; when will his labor end?' 'Simpletons! Let him put the oar into another man's hand and jump ashore; the other will be ferryman in his place.' 'Now let me be, for I must rise early to go dry the tears the king's daughter sheds every night for her husband—the charcoal-burner's son whom the king sent for my three golden hairs.'\n\nIn the morning the Sun flew out the eastern window as a golden-haired child. The old woman lifted the tub: 'Here are the three golden hairs, and the answers too. Off with you!'\n\nPlaváček returned by the same road. The king of the first city killed the toad and cleaned the spring and gave Plaváček twelve white horses laden with treasure. The king of the second city killed the snake, transplanted the tree, and gave him twelve black horses laden with treasure. The ferryman ferried him across; then Plaváček said, 'When another comes, hand him the oar and jump ashore,' and went on.\n\nWhen he brought the three golden hairs, the king could scarcely believe it. 'And where did you get such fine horses and riches?' 'I earned them by helping a king to living water and another to rejuvenating apples,' said Plaváček. The greedy king set out at once to fetch both. He never returned—for on the Black Sea he took the ferryman's oar and, having put it into his hand, the ferryman leapt ashore. And perhaps the king is still ferrying there to this day.\n\nThus did the charcoal-burner's son become the king's son-in-law, as the Fates decreed.",

        "content": "There was once a pretty little girl whom everyone loved as soon as they saw her, most of all her grandmother, who did not know what to give the child next. She made her a little cap of red velvet, and as it suited her so well and she would wear nothing else, they called her Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nOne day her mother said, 'Go, Red Riding Hood; here is cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother; she is sick and weak and will be strengthened. Be good, don't dawdle or look about, and when you get into her room, don't forget to say good morning. Keep to the path, or you will fall and break the bottle, and then your poor grandmother will have nothing.' Red Riding Hood promised to do everything properly and gave her mother her hand on it.\n\nGrandmother lived half an hour deep in the forest. When Red Riding Hood came among the trees, a wolf met her. She did not know what a wicked beast he was and was not afraid. 'God help you, Red Riding Hood,' said he. 'Thank you kindly, wolf!' 'Where so early, Red Riding Hood?' 'To grandmother's.' 'What have you in your basket?' 'Cake and wine; we baked yesterday, and poor sick grandmother must have something good to make her strong.' 'Where does your grandmother live, Red Riding Hood?' 'A good quarter of an hour farther into the forest, under the three great oaks; her house stands there. You must know it,' said Red Riding Hood.\n\nThe wolf thought, 'What a tender mouthful—better than the old woman. If I am crafty, I shall catch both.' He walked a while with the girl, then said, 'Look how beautifully the flowers bloom everywhere! Why don't you look around? And listen how sweetly the birds sing. You walk on as if you were going to school, and yet it is so cheerful here in the wood.' Red Riding Hood looked up; the sunbeams danced among the tree-tops, flowers blossomed and scented all around, and she thought, 'If I take grandmother a fresh nosegay, that will please her too; it is still early; I shall be in time.' She ran into the underwood to pick flowers; whenever she picked one she thought a prettier one grew farther on, and she ran after it, going deeper and deeper into the forest.\n\nMeanwhile the wolf went straight to grandmother's and knocked. 'Who is there?' 'Red Riding Hood, bringing cake and wine; open up!' 'Lift the latch,' called grandmother; 'I am too weak to get up.' The wolf lifted the latch, went in without a word to the bed, and ate the grandmother up. Then he put on her clothes, set her cap upon his head, lay down in her bed, and drew the curtains.\n\nRed Riding Hood, after gathering so many flowers that she could carry no more, remembered her grandmother again and went straight to the little house. She found the door open and, on entering the room, felt strange and thought, 'Ah, my God, how uneasy I feel today; at other times I am so glad at grandmother's!' She said, 'Good morning!' but received no answer. She went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay grandmother, with her cap pulled far over her face, and she looked very odd. 'Grandmother, what big ears you have!' 'The better to hear you with.' 'Grandmother, what big eyes you have!' 'The better to see you with.' 'Grandmother, what big hands you have!' 'The better to hold you with.' 'But grandmother, what a terribly big mouth you have!' 'The better to eat you with!' With that the wolf sprang out of bed upon the poor girl and ate her.\n\nWhen the wolf had satisfied his gluttony, he lay down again, fell asleep, and snored loudly. A hunter happened to pass by the house and thought, 'How can an old woman snore so? I must see what this is.' He went in and looked at the bed; there lay the wolf. 'I have found you at last, you old sinner,' said he. He was going to fire, but he thought the wolf might have eaten the grandmother and that she might still be saved. So he took a pair of shears and began cutting open the sleeping wolf's belly. After a few snips Red Riding Hood appeared; after a few more the grandmother came out, still alive but hardly able to breathe. Red Riding Hood ran for great stones; they filled the wolf's belly with them; when he woke and tried to spring up and run away, the stones were so heavy that he fell down dead.\n\nAll three were glad. The hunter took the wolf's pelt, the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine that Red Riding Hood had brought, and grew well again; and Red Riding Hood thought, 'As long as I live I will never leave the path in the forest again, as mother told me.'",

        "content": "A poor cobbler worked late on a Saturday mending old shoes and went to church on Sunday. There he heard a sermon: whoever gives his property to God, the Lord will repay a hundredfold by other means. Being poor but pious, he sold his cottage and last tools and took the money to the priest for the church. Days passed; the children cried with hunger; his wife scolded him; and no recompense appeared. At last, driven by need, the cobbler dressed as a beggar, took a staff, and went to seek God.\n\nHunger-bitten, he came upon an old shepherd with a great flock of sheep and begged for a few scraps. Hearing the man's story, the shepherd took pity and gave him a lamb with this warning: whenever you say, 'Little lamb, shake yourself,' ducats will pour from him; but do not stop at your godmother's inn. Joyful, the cobbler tried the words in secret and saw the gold. But passing his godmother's tavern he yielded to her entreaties and vanity, entrusted her with the lamb '—only don't say: Little lamb, shake yourself!'—and let himself be plied with liquor. The sly godmother swapped the lamb for an ordinary one while he slept. At home the lamb produced nothing; hunger returned; back he went to the shepherd.\n\nThe shepherd now gave him a napkin: 'Napkin, spread yourself!' and the finest food and drink will appear. Again he warned him to avoid the godmother. The cobbler, weak with hunger, tested the gift and ate his fill; then, passing the tavern, he was coaxed in once more and, after drink, the godmother exchanged the napkin for an ordinary cloth. At home the napkin did nothing. Desperate, he returned a third time.\n\nThe shepherd at last gave him a stout staff banded with silver and set with stones, and said: 'Stop at your godmother's this time, and remember these words: “Cudgel, move!” and these: “Cudgel, enough!”' On the way he tried it; two hulking fellows sprang up and thrashed him soundly until he cried 'Cudgel, enough!' 'Good,' said the cobbler; 'you will help me to my former gifts.'\n\nHe went to his godmother, who fawned and asked if he had anything for her to keep safe. He handed her the staff with the warning not to say 'Cudgel, move!' Of course she did, and the cudgel-men fell upon her; the innkeeper ran to help and was beaten too, while the cobbler called, 'Cudgel, more! more! until she gives back my lamb and my napkin!' She brought them out at last. 'Cudgel, enough!' said the cobbler; he took all three gifts home, and there was great joy: they had always money and food enough and did not forget God or the poor, but helped everyone in need.",
