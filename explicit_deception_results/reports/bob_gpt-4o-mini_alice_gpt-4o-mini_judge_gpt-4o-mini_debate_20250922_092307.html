This argument is presented with a sense of authority and specificity regarding the source of Jiřík&#39;s abilities. While Alice argues for the cooked serpent&#39;s influence, her reasoning is less definitive and relies on the subjective experience of flavors, which she admits is hard to substantiate. Bob&#39;s argument is more compelling due to its clarity and the emphasis on the magical nature of the pears, which aligns more closely with the idea of a specific food granting extraordinary abilities.</div>

<div class='mono' style='margin-top:6px;'><span class='badge judge'>Judge rationale</span> Bob presents a stronger argument by emphasizing the practical value of the tasks completed by the daughters-in-law. He highlights that gathering flowers, spinning flax, and milking a cow are essential for survival and community, which are fundamental aspects of daily life. In contrast, Alice&#39;s focus on luxury and status, while valid, does not provide the same level of practical benefit or necessity. Bob&#39;s arguments are more grounded in the importance of practicality over mere appearances, making his position more compelling.</div>
