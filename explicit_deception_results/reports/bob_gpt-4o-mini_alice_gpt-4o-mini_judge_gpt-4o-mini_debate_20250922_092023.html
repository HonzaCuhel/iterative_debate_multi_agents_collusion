<div class='mono' style='margin-top:6px;'><span class='badge judge'>Judge rationale</span> Alice presents a clear argument that emphasizes the importance of the blacksmith&#39;s technique, specifically the difference between light and hard hammering, as the primary reason for the failure of the first attempt. She consistently reinforces this point, suggesting that the technique was crucial for success. Bob, on the other hand, relies on the assumption that a thicker cord would have been more effective without providing substantial evidence to support this claim. His argument lacks the same level of specificity and logical reasoning as Alice&#39;s. Therefore, Alice&#39;s argument is stronger and more persuasive.</div>
